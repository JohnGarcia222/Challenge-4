# Risk-Return Analysis
-----------------------------

In this risk-return analysis project you will see a comparison of the risk-return of four different fund portfolios and S&P 500. This includes rolling window, volatiliy, overall returns and standard deviation. Throughout the entries inside of this coding project there will be a common theme hinting towards S&P 500 and how they have a serious advantage over the other funds and also feed into how the other funds behave.

# Installing Software

---------------------------------

Start your process with the installation of JupyterLab (https://jupyter.org/install)
 
Following the installation you would want to grab the line repo code from github.

After grabbing the url or the SSH you need to clone the repository into a new folder (or a premade one for this repository)

launch JupyterLab once the repository has been added and JupyterLab is open, you should now be able to run the program.

# Code Usage

-----------------------------------

As stated in the description of this project you will find a comparison of four fund portfolios and S&P 500 within running this code. It is not recommened to change the code unless you input a csv file to pull from and then procede to go through and change every instance of the code where a specific csv path was pulled.
