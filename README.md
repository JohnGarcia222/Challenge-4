# Risk-Return Analysis
-----------------------------

In this risk-return analysis project you will see a comparison of, in dumbed down terms, the risk-return of four different fund portfolios and S&P 500. This includes rolling window, volatiliy, overall returns and standard deviation.

-------------------------------------------

# Technologies Used
------------------------------

Operating System: Mac OS, Windows
  
Programming Language: Python
  
Framework: Jupyter Lab, can use VS Code
 
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, and Pathlib
